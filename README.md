#DSA Project
#project proposal

-This is on online clothes shopping app which  is going to be used by two 
groups of people, the c customers, and the owner.The customer can buy products and view products
available in the store and the Owner can add new products and delete products from the store



#what it is about 
This is am online shopping back end program where we are putting into practical 
what we learnt in Data Structures , we decided to create something like this
because we felt like we already have a fashion brand that is running so it will
be good to create a platform for users to find it easy to buy products using our online
app



#library to be downloaded
the user has to install PySide2 in order to run the program in their pycharm
-import unittest
- you have to install the package into your pycharm then you import it to the programimport PyPDF2
- you have to install the python docx then you import it to the program import docx
we imported docx because as an organisation we wanted to be able to recorded every action our user takes
on our platform so it create a document in your name as soon as you input your details to start the program

-import sys
-from io import StringIO

#Whats new
- so basically want we want to learn to do is to put graphics becasue as you can see this 
is just the back end

#what we need to work on
- so when it comes to our delete function we are not sure how to go about it
that is why you can see we are just printing the available clothes ,so we need help with that
